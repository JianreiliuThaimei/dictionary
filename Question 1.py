# Question 1
# Write a program such that the below given
# dictionaries are into a single dictionary 
# and add the values having same key
# dic1={1:10, 2:20}
# dic2={3:30,2:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# for i in dic1:
#     if i in dic2:
#         dic2[i]=dic1[i]+dic2[i]
# dic1.update(dic2)
# dic1.update(dic3)
# print(dic1)

# dict1={"ten":10,"twenty":20,"thirty":30}
# dict2={"thirty":30,"fourty":40,"fifty":50}
# for i in dict1:
#     if i in dict2:
#         dict2[i]=dict1[i]
# dict1.update(dict2)
# print(dict1)
